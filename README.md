# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository focuses on Requirement Analysis in software development, with a case study on a Booking Management System. It covers key activities, types of requirements, use case diagrams, and acceptance criteria to provide a structured foundation for developing software solutions.
## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) where the project team gathers, analyzes, and defines the requirements of the software product to be developed. This process ensures that all stakeholders have a clear and mutual understanding of what the system should do and how it should perform.

During Requirement Analysis, the team identifies functional and non-functional requirements, clarifies ambiguities, and lays the foundation for designing and developing the system. This step is essential to ensure that the final product aligns with user expectations and business objectives.
